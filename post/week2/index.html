      <p>My second week was hectic &ndash; not only was I traveling for the weekend, my
phone broke Thursday night, making documentation very difficult. This week
were assigned to make a press fit construction kit. I had several ideas of
things I wanted to make including:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Eiffel Tower</li>
<li>A plant/flower of some sort</li>
<li>Something Valentine&rsquo;s day related</li>
<li>A flexible self-intersecting single-piece kit</li>
<li>Animal bookshelf (inspired by <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.15/section.CBA/people/Liu/index.html">this</a>)</li>
<li>Bitmap art for my wall</li>
<li>Bookends for my bookshelf</li>
<li>A geodesic dome</li>
</ul>
<p>My strongest interest was in the geodesic domes. The structure of these
domes are similar to that of an icosahedron but more closely approximate
a sphere. They were developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster
Fuller</a>, who I am
interested in for his work in design and architecture, his <a href="https://www.wired.com/2006/12/the-dymaxion-ch/">profuse record
keeping</a>, and
his neologism like &ldquo;tensegrity,&rdquo; &ldquo;synergy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;world-around&rdquo;. Making
a dome with the laser cutter seemed particularly challenging and
appealing to me because of the non-orthogonal geometry of the faces. Most
of the other projects I had seen when browsing consisted only of pieces
meeting at right angles. You may have seen geodesic domes on playgrounds or
in architectural structures:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week2/playground_dome.jpg" alt="Playground Dome"></p>
<p><img src="../../img/week2/world_fair_dome.jpg" alt="World Fair Dome"></p>
<p>Given that the angles in these structures are highly mathematical and
complex to calculate by hand, I consulted the internet to see if anybody
had made large geodesics in programs like fusion. I found one <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.18/Harvard/people/david/week2_laser.html">student</a> who
had made a geodesic lamp in a previous iteration of the fab-lab course at
MIT. The final product looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week2/geodesic_lamp.jpg" alt="Geodesic Lamp"></p>
<p>and the student ended with a comment that in a future iteration, he would
turn the pentagonal panels outwards to allow more light to escape.</p>
<p>I planned to start with a geodesic dome and hopefully find a way to invert
these pentagonal structures. From this site I also found several resources
on how to construct appropriate angles. The most helpful of these was
a <a href="https://dahp.wa.gov/sites/default/files/Domebook_2_1971smaller.pdf">book</a>
that contained numerous types of geodesic dome structures (even elliptical
domes!!). In the book I found a diagram with method of construction for
a frequency 2 geodesic dome (an icosahedron is a frequency 1 geodesic
dome):</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week2/angles.jpg" alt="Angles"></p>
<p>This diagram indicates that there will be 80 total faces in the figure and
the lower triangles along with the measurements above indicate the
relative sizes of edges in the dome and the angles between faces, or
dihedral angles.</p>
<p>With this information, I set out to create this structure in <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview">Fusion
360</a>. I entered the
measurements above as parameters in case I needed to adjust them later.
I started by making sketches of each component. I needed one piece for the
equilateral triangle in the center, and one piece for the isosceles
triangles around it. I would also need connecting pieces at the edges.
Note that there are two different dihedral angles depending on the faces
the angle is between so I will need two types of connecting pieces.
The design for my pieces is below:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week2/aaa.png" alt="aaa">
<img src="../../img/week2/abb.png" alt="abb">
<img src="../../img/week2/ab.png" alt="ab">
<img src="../../img/week2/bb.png" alt="bb"></p>
<p>After making these sketches, I was able to turn them into bodies by
extrusion. My first confusion with Fusion 360 arose at this point. I was
very comfortable with the 2D sketches, where I learned about constraints
and dimensions. In 3 dimensions, however, I now had to combine the pieces
I&rsquo;d made in non-orthogonal ways. Before that, I would have to duplicate
the pieces and find a way to put them together at all.</p>
<p>I found a feature in Fusion called components, which allowed me to
&ldquo;assemble&rdquo; pieces using joints. While the difference between components
and bodies was not clear to me at first, Nathan explained that components
act as containers for bodies and have several additional features,
including the ability to add joints between components that hold them
together, and to make rigid groups of components that stay together. After
a long journey to discover this, I still had difficulty moving copied
components around independently. Every time I copied a component and tried
to translate it, all of the other components would be translated by the
same amount. What I wanted was a set of components that were tied to the
same body (so that if I changed the user parameters the shape of the
components would all change) but that were positionally distinct. The
feature that eventually resolved this for me was the &ldquo;Paste New&rdquo; feature,
which provided exactly this functionality.</p>
<p>Two other features that were helpful in assembling the shape were the
align function and the point to point translation function. The first
allowed me to align two faces of different components in the same plane
before moving their slots together and the second allowed me to move the
slots of connected components to the exact same point.</p>
<p>Though I was able to (almost) put together a pentagon, it was a very
difficult and slow process.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week2/pentagon.png" alt="pentagon"></p>
<p>Because I did not return from my travels until Tuesday and had worked
a few hours with no end in sight, I decided to turn to an easier project
first.</p>
<p>A simpler project I had thought of was a flexible, self-intersecting,
single-piece kit. I was inspired by some of the pieces I had seen in the
lab that had many little cuts and allowed flexion of the cardboard.
I wondered what these pieces would look like if instead of tiny cuts, the
cutouts were full slots that could be used to connect pieces of the
cardboard to itself. After sketching out a design, I got to work in
fusion. To give you an idea of the piece I was imagining, here is the
final product:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week2/flat.jpg" alt="flat"></p>
<p>To make the design parametric, I wanted a variable number of slots in each
&ldquo;wing&rdquo; of this piece. I also wanted to be able to control how deep the
slots of the wings were, how deep the slots in the centers were, and how
thick the squiggles in the wings were. I had many parameters by the time
I&rsquo;d added these and other convenient parameters to Fusion:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week2/parameters.png" alt="parameters"></p>
<p>I planned to make the sketch by first constructing one &ldquo;squiggle&rdquo; and then
using the rectangular pattern feature to extend it num_units times.This
would create a single wing that I could then rotate with the circular
pattern feature. After this was done I could extrude and project to get
the final product. Unfortunately it was not this simple. After making
a squiggle and using the rectangular pattern feature I had a result that
looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week2/translate_before_rotation.png" alt="translate before rotate">
After the circular pattern, things looked good:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week2/rotation_after_translation.png" alt="rotation after translate"></p>
<p>This was actually deceiving, though. When I changed the number of units
that I had, the original rectangular pattern updated, but the circular
pattern copies did not:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week2/unconstrained_parameters.png" alt="unconstrained"></p>
<p>Note also that the lines became blue. I learned that in Fusion, if an
object does not have enough constraints to uniquely determine its
position, then it is in blue, while if it has enough it appears in black.
This transition from constrained to unconstrained was very bad. It meant
that when I changed the number of units, it lost track of where everything
was supposed to be. After some Googling, I found no solution to this
problem. Instead, I tried another approach that seemed a little more work
intensive. Rather than doing the rectangular pattern first, I did the
circular pattern first and then the rectangular pattern four times, in
hopes that updating a parameter after this would update all four patterns.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week2/rotation_before_translation.png" alt="rotation first"></p>
<p>This is what the sketch looked like after my rotation in this case. Using
the rectangular pattern 4 times did in fact allow me to update the number
of units on all sides at once. Unfortunately, the sketch lines still
turned blue, meaning the system was unconstrained after changing one
parameter. This also occurred if I changed the parameter x (thickness of
the squiggles). I&rsquo;m still not sure why this happened but hypothesize that
it could be a limitation of the rectangular pattern feature of fusion.
I used a variable (num_units) to specify the number of repetitions, and
also used a variable (unit_length) to specify how far apart to space the
units. Whenever I changed a parameter related to these quantities, the
figure lines seemed to become unconstrained. Despite being unable to
resolve this problem, I was able to laser cut an example by setting the
parameters for number of units beforehand, this allowed me to play with
the edge thickness one time before the system became unconstrained.</p>
<p>My first iteration had 7 squiggles and an edge thickness of 4.3mm. When
I tried to join this piece to itself, the edge was too thin and bent:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week2/bent.jpg" alt="bent"></p>
<p>For a second iteration, I made the edge a little thicker (6mm) and
increased the number of slots to 11. This iteration fit together better
and did not distort the cardboard in the process. I was able to fold the
piece in several ways, some of my favorites are shown here:</p>

<img src="../../img/week2/outward.jpg" alt="outward">
<img src="../../img/week2/arches.jpg" alt="arches"></p>
<p>I hope to have a chance to better document the actual cutting process soon now
that I have a new phone(!!). I also am continuing to work on the
icosahedron as I learn more about fusion.</p>
