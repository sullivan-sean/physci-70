      <article class="post-content">
      <p>For the first week of class, we experimented with microcontrollers, building our
first circuits on breadboards. Loosely following a
<a href="https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Electronics/electronic_basics.html">guide</a>
introducing basic electronics, I built a circuit using the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3800">Adafruit ItsyBitsy
M4</a> controller. The circuit I set out to
build can be represented in the following diagram:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week1/diagram.jpg" alt="Circuit Diagram"></p>
<p>For power source (5V) and ground (GND), I used the 3V and GND terminals of the
microcontroller respectively. After fun stripping and cutting wires, I assembled
the circuit as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week1/basic_LED.jpg" alt="Basic LED"></p>
<p>My circuit did not work on the first try as I had reversed the direction of the
LED. By switching the location of the two legs, I was able to get the LED to
light up.</p>
<p>After assembling the initial circuit, I wanted to learn more about the
underlying connections within the breadboard. I looked at the conducting and
insulating materials on the underside of example breadboards that had been
deconstructed. It looked something like this:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week1/breadboard.jpg" alt="Breadboard Back"></p>
<p>I then attempted to make a circuit that eliminated all of the wire pieces I had
used initially, with the result here:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week1/short_LED.jpg" alt="Short LED"></p>
<p>On this circuit I used a multimeter to measure voltage differences across the
resistor and LED.</p>
<p>Lastly, I used the Arduino IDE to get the built in LED on the microcontroller to
blink.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week1/blink.gif" alt="Blink"></p>
<p>This did not work off the bat either. I had plugged the microusb adapter from
the microcontroller into a USB port on my computer, but the Arduino IDE was
unable to access this port unless I ran the progam as a root user. After
reinstalling the Adafruit board for the root user, I was able to detect the
board and run the blink example program.</p>
<h2 id="project-ideas">Project Ideas</h2>
<p>I've been and will continue to brainstorm project ideas but I'm sure these will
change as I better understand what is feasible and what is not.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Biotracking ring</strong>: Since getting a smartwatch, I've been able to track my
heart rate and sleep. I've been frustrated with the need to manually enter
activities (when am I walking, running, etc.), the inability to track my
precise location, and inability to automatically connect to wifi and back up
data (the interface provided on my phone is far from ideal). I would like to
create a more compact and stylish device that provides these functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Autonomous Skateboard</strong>: I recently built a longboard and think a second
iteration of skateboard construction would lead to a better final product. I'd
like to modify the board to be electrically powered, and possibly to have some
steering capabilities. While full autonomy might not be possible (e.g.
intersections would be <em>very</em> difficult) steering around objects in a
classroom could be an interesting challenge.</p>
</li>
</ul>
