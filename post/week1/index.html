      <article class="post-content">
      <p>For the first week of class, we experimented with microcontrollers, building our
first circuits on breadboards. Loosely following a
<a href="https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Electronics/electronic_basics.html">guide</a>
introducing basic electronics, I built a circuit using the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3800">Adafruit ItsyBitsy
M4</a> controller. The circuit I set out to
build can be represented in the following diagram:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week1/diagram.jpg" alt="Circuit Diagram"></p>
<p>For power source (5V) and ground (GND), I used the 3V and GND terminals of the
microcontroller respectively. After fun stripping and cutting wires, I assembled
the circuit as below:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week1/basic_LED.jpg" alt="Basic LED"></p>
<p>My circuit did not work on the first try as I had reversed the direction of the
LED. By switching the location of the two legs, I was able to get the LED to
light up.</p>
<p>After assembling the initial circuit, I wanted to learn more about the
underlying connections within the breadboard. I looked at the conducting and
insulating materials on the underside of example breadboards that had been
deconstructed. It looked something like this:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week1/breadboard.jpg" alt="Breadboard Back"></p>
<p>I then attempted to make a circuit that eliminated all of the wire pieces I had
used initially, with the result here:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week1/short_LED.jpg" alt="Short LED"></p>
<p>On this circuit I used a multimeter to measure voltage differences across the
resistor and LED. There was a 0.667V reading across the resistor and
a 2.333V reading across the LED. This means first that the voltage is
monotonically decreasing throughout the circuit and second that all 3V
that we started with were &ldquo;used.&rdquo; The bands across the resistor indicate
that it is a 1k Ohm resistor:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/resistorcodes.png" alt="Resistor codes"></p>
<p>Using Ohm&rsquo;s law, we then know that the current through the resistor is:
$$I=\frac{V}{R}=\frac{0.667V}{1000 \Omega}=0.667 mA$$
Current is constant through a series circuit so this is also the current
through the LED.</p>
<p>Lastly, I used the Arduino IDE to get the built-in LED on the microcontroller to
blink.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week1/blink.gif" alt="Blink"></p>
<p>This did not work immediately either. I plugged the MicroUSB adapter from
the microcontroller into a USB port on my computer, but the Arduino IDE was
unable to access this port unless I ran the program as a root user. After
reinstalling the Adafruit board for the root user, I was able to detect the
board and run the blink example program.</p>
<h2 id="project-ideas">Project Ideas</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been and will continue to brainstorm project ideas but I&rsquo;m sure these will
change as I better understand what is feasible and what is not.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Biotracking ring</strong>: Since getting a smartwatch, I&rsquo;ve been able to track my
heart rate and sleep. I&rsquo;ve been frustrated with the need to manually enter
activities (when am I walking, running, etc.), the inability to track my
precise location, and inability to automatically connect to wifi and back up
data (the interface provided on my phone is far from ideal). I would like to
create a more compact and stylish device that provides these functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Autonomous Skateboard</strong>: I recently built a longboard and think a second
iteration of skateboard construction would lead to a better final product. I&rsquo;d
like to modify the board to be electrically powered, and possibly to have some
steering capabilities. While full autonomy might not be possible (e.g.
intersections would be <em>very</em> difficult) steering around objects in a
classroom could be an interesting challenge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Micro Keyboard</strong>: I&rsquo;ve seen collapsible keyboards but they often fold up
when not on a flat surface. I&rsquo;d like to use my phone as my computer (ssh).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pose Tracking Clothes Inserts</strong>: Similar to bio tracking, I&rsquo;d like to have
inserts for my socks and shirt sleeves to track how my body is moving
throughout the day. They&rsquo;d need to be removable so that I can wash my clothes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solar powered X</strong>:  ???</p>
</li>
</ul>
