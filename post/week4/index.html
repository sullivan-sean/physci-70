      <h3 id="getting-arduino-setup">Getting Arduino Setup</h3>
<p>At first, my Arduino board wouldn&rsquo;t work, even after installing packages
with Board Manager for <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/add-boards-arduino-v164/setup">Adafruit
SAMD</a>. While
code would compile fine in the IDE, whenever I tried to upload to the
board I got the error &ldquo;Permission Denied.&rdquo; In order to solve this problem,
I investigated the permissions on the port I had plugged the device into.
By running</p>
<pre><code>ls -l /dev/ttyACM0 
</code></pre><p>I found that the group permissions for the port was set to the group
<code>uucp</code>. My user (<code>sean</code>) was not in this group so I ran <code>sudo usermod -aG uucp sean</code> to add myself to this group as I run arch linux. On other systems,
this command will differ but the general solution was to add my user to
the group with permissions to access the port. An alternative solution
could have been to change the user group with permission to the port, for
example to all users, with <code>chown root:users /dev/ttyACM0</code>.</p>
<h3 id="self-activating-motor">Self Activating Motor</h3>
<p>For this project, I wanted to make a motor that was capable of using
momentum to press a button and turn itself on momentarily. After it turned
far enough that the button wasn&rsquo;t pressed, it would turn off and only its
momentum would be left to carry it to hit the button again.</p>
<p>To start out making this, I found a simple transistor-driven motor project
in the <a href="https://bastiaanvanhengel.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/arduino_projects_book.pdf">Arduino starter
guide</a></p>
<p>The circuit diagram is pretty simple and the code is just as simple:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week4/diagram.jpg" alt="diagram"></p>
<p>The circuit operates by using a transistor as a switch to activate the
motor. When the button is pressed, the loop code:</p>
<pre><code>void loop(){
  switchState = digitalRead(switchPin);
  if (switchState == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(motorPin, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(motorPin, LOW);
  }
}
</code></pre><p>writes to the motor pin, pin 9, which increases the voltage into the gate
pin of the transistor to allow current to flow to the motor.</p>
<p>I gathered the parts necessary:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week4/parts.jpg" alt="parts"></p>
<p>In order to put the motor together I had to solder wires onto a geared
motor. I chose the geared motor to spin more slowly.
The first motor I soldered didn&rsquo;t work when I plugged it into a voltage
source. I should&rsquo;ve tested it before soldering, whoops! Instead I had to
unsolder another motor and resolder longer wires onto it.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week4/solder_motor.jpg" alt="motor"></p>
<p>Finally, the motor did not work with just one battery. Instead I had to
add multiple batteries in parallel:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week4/parallel.jpg" alt="parallel"></p>
<p>and use a heat gun to attach wires compatible with the breadboard to the
battery cap:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week4/heat_gun.jpg" alt="heat gun"></p>
<p>After assembling everything, the circuit still didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week4/complete.jpg" alt="complete"></p>
<p>After much troubleshooting, I found that the transistor I used had too
large a threshold voltage. Switching the transistor made the motor work.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/week4/out.gif" alt="vid"></p>
<p>This is as far as I got. The motor runs but I was unable to attach
something that would hit the button in the right way. Going forward I hope
to 3d print a part that allows the button to be pressed even without
a full rotation.</p>
