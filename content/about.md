Hi! I'm Sean, currently a junior at Harvard pursuing a joint B.A. in
Neuroscience and M.S. in Applied Mathematics. I like building things with
other people. I've taken two semesters off from school, the first to
co-found [Summer Playbook](https://www.summerplaybook.com) and the second
to live in a [van](https://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers) while building
autonomous robots at [Nuro](https://www.nuro.ai). I love talking about
[brain computer interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface)
and the importance of [sleep](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZZ1YGJ5). This
semester I'm reaching far out of my comfort zone to dance with
[Expressions](https://www.harvardexpressions.com)
