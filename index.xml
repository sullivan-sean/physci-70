      <description>My second week was hectic &amp;ndash; not only was I traveling for the weekend, my phone broke Thursday night, making documentation very difficult. This week were assigned to make a press fit construction kit. I had several ideas of things I wanted to make including:
 An Eiffel Tower A plant/flower of some sort Something Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day related A flexible self-intersecting single-piece kit Animal bookshelf (inspired by this) Bitmap art for my wall Bookends for my bookshelf A geodesic dome  My strongest interest was in the geodesic domes.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Sean, currently a junior at Harvard pursuing a joint B.A. in Neuroscience and M.S. in Applied Mathematics. I like building things with other people. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken two semesters off from school, the first to co-found Summer Playbook and the second to live in a van while building autonomous robots at Nuro. I love talking about brain computer interfaces and the importance of sleep. This semester I&amp;rsquo;m reaching far out of my comfort zone to dance with Expressions</description>

      <description>For the first week of class, we experimented with microcontrollers, building our first circuits on breadboards. Loosely following a guide introducing basic electronics, I built a circuit using the Adafruit ItsyBitsy M4 controller. The circuit I set out to build can be represented in the following diagram:
For power source (5V) and ground (GND), I used the 3V and GND terminals of the microcontroller respectively. After fun stripping and cutting wires, I assembled the circuit as below:</description>
